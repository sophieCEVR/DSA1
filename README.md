# Subseries Search

Data Structures and Algorithms Coursework 1 for University of East Anglia.

### Coursework Description ### 

 Write an algorithm in pseudo code that takes as input a subsequence `S` of length `k` and a list of series
```
T =< T1,T2,...,Tn >
``` 
where each series is of length `n` and returns the index of the series and the
starting point of the subseries that has the lowest distance to query series `S`.

  Implement your algorithm (including an implementation of a distance function and a means of
 handling ties in distance), and run a timing experiment to estimate the average case complexity,
 using randomly generated data created with the provided code. Assume `k` is fixed and plot how the time taken changes with `n`.
 
 ### Running the Coursework ### 

To Run the coursework, clone the git repo on a machine with Java SDK setup. Build the project then run the project. 
The output will show the index of the series and the starting point of the subseries that has the lowest distance to query series `s`.
In the form:

```
    T [n] [m]
```
